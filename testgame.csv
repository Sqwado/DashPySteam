Download and play today to find out why Cthulhu Realms is so crazily addictive! How to Play the Game: In Cthulhu Realms, each player tries to drive their opponent insane or have more sanity than their opponents when the deck runs out. Each player starts the game with a small deck comprised of initiates, goons and followers. Five cards from the deck form a row of available cards on the table; with more than two players, place three available cards between each pair of players. Each turn, you start with five cards in hand, playing those cards in order to put locations into play, boost your own sanity or reduce that of others, collect conjuring power to acquire new cards, and remove cards from the game. You can use the power of your locations once each turn. At the end of your turn, discard any cards still in hand and all entities and artifacts that you played. If you lose all of your sanity, you're out of the game. If you're the only one at the table who's still sane, you win. Otherwise, the game ends when the deck runs out and whoever has the most sanity wins. Darwin Kastle is the designer of the popular Star Realms Deckbuilding Game, and with the digital release of Cthulhu Realms, he once again provides tons of playability for free, and a one-time upgrade to be able play with your friends and more on any device.

Game is posing a question what if? What if Tianxian Empire was able to colonize Siberia before Russia did and later had started war to extend its ownership over the rest of Europe and America? Players acting for the 3 of the world superpowers - Britain, Tianxia and the Holy Roman Empires have teams of up to 8 units equipped with guns and machinery of the times of WWI in order to complete 30 tactical missions. For instance, you can be asked to capture an area, defend a lodgement or a person, attempt to sabotage, etc. To succeed in the game, players must: Equip their teams according to the chosen strategy - select the right units, ammunition and armory for the mission; Read mission tactical maps; Lead units in the smart way and accurately - they are so easily killed and you have only few of them; Key Features Realisticity and complexity - actions in the game are driven by solid physic based combat mechanics and this is what it makes to be similar to the classics of table games - Warhammer, Infinity the Game; Possibility to use its own and take over enemy equipment - tanks, cannons and mortars; Possibility to equip units according to the tasks of the missions and your preferences; Original weaponry that is similar to the one used during the times of Great War; Battlecam with a depth of field effect and nice color correction, that gives an old film feeling; Beautiful settings as if drawn by Miyazaki himself; Nice little perks like - destroyable environment, interactive fauna and melee weapons; We sincerely want you to enjoy Steam Squad as we tried hard to make it interesting.

810740,Turtle Lu,"Mar 22, 2018",20000 - 50000,0,0,2.99,0,"Turtle Lu Turtle Lu is an old-school Action-Adventure game, Explore immense 2D Zones. Day after day, Lu watched creepy little caterpillars crawl past his window. Everywhere. Like the pitter patter of birds on a tin roof, the squirming sensation of moles crawling under the floor. The days flew by, each like the one before, monotonous. Lu lay down with the sunset every night, and awoke to the cock-a-doodle doo of the rooster outside every morning. The months passed by, the spring rain, autumn sun, leaves of fall and nowsnow is falling on the roof. Lu curled up in his shell and fell into a long, deep sleep. Winter was as it always is, and soon the first rays of the sun broke through the dirty, cobwebbed window. 'It looks like it's time to wake up ' he thought, opening his heavy eyes.

Draw Your Game is a user-friendly application allowing anyone and everyone to create their own video game in a few quick steps: ▶ Draw your game's world on a piece of paper, using four different colors (black, blue, green and red). ▶ Use the 'Draw Your Game' app to take a picture of your drawing. ▶ Wait 10 seconds, while Draw Your Game transforms the drawing into a game. ▶ Play your game, with a character that you can control. ▶ Share your creation with other Draw Your Game users. Four different colors to create the world of your choosing: ▶ Black for stationary floors/ground; ▶ Blue for movable objects that the character can push around; ▶ Green for elements that the character will bounce off of; ▶ Red for objects that will destroy the character or the blue objects. Draw Your Game allows you to create an infinite number of worlds, either on the same sheet of paper or by adding new sheets, one after the other, to create a real story line. There are two available modes: ▶ “Create” mode, to create your own worlds; ▶ “Play” mode, to play in the worlds created by the community, either in “campaign” mode (worlds selected by our team), or in “catalogue” mode, where you can use search criteria to choose a world yourself. There are several ways to play the different worlds, at the creator's choice: ▶ “Escape”: the character must find a way off the paper to escape and win the game; ▶ “Destruction”: the character must push blue objects into red ones to destroy them. Our teams approve each new world before releasing it to the community, and a rating system is used to rank the top worlds against one another.

About: ‘Unhappy Ever After’ is a dark, yet funny, RPG that takes traditional fairy tales and turns them on their heads. Along your journey you will meet familiar characters that you’ve know all your life and see them in new situations and within frameworks that you will make you both laugh and despair. Beyond its parody to the fantasy, ‘Unhappy Ever After’ also aims to parody the real, drawing on situations that are all too pervasive in our world, such as drug abuse, terrorism, and dirty politics. Death too is a prevalent theme and no character, no matter how well known, how famous, or how integral to the plot, is safe from its cold hand! Despite its beautiful graphics, wondrous music, and humorous interludes, ‘Unhappy Ever After’ is a game, in places, designed to shock and appal, and where your decisions, no matter how noble can lead to devastating ends. Features: * Explore a free-roam world where you decide who to help and who to leave to their own fate. * Meet characters from ancient stories and rhymes such as Hansel and Gretel,or Little Red Riding Hood. * A unique magic system where strengthening one ability weakens another. * An addictive drug system, complete with dealers and quests. * An adult-themed RPG with political coups, terrorism, drugs, murder, and revenge. * Beautiful lands to explore. * A coming of age story with meaningful character progression. * Team up with interesting and powerful companions each with their own story, conversations, and personalities! * A day and night system where characters go to bed and monsters come out at night. * 14 hour story-line with many extra side quests, plus another 2 hour free bonus DLC 'The Maze of Cefgellin' * Play on after the story's end, doing quests, and building up your character and base camp. * Controller support, Mouse and Keyboard - full keybinding.",['English'],[],“Unhappy Ever After is the result of a wicked mind’s imagination!” 8/10 – OPN,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/header.jpg?t=1490429559,,http://warpedtales.weebly.com/,the.warped.tales@gmail.com,True,True,True,0,,0,16,10,,0,0,,218,0,218,0,Warped Tales,Warped Tales,"Single-player,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support","Adventure,Indie,RPG","Adventure,Indie,RPG,RPGMaker,Dark Fantasy,Fantasy,Magic,Dark Comedy","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_2633a000f0c52ddd4aaa4f6ba6f92315b72c6b32.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_97f13cdc8e0f2efac222d00dcad65c2f9f786a92.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_845b2a32cc31afa264587e4bff3dfcb47780a7eb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_c643f2814b34930b2faae562237dd1336822c024.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_1aaae69f2399d3df81056fcfa3ce28dcbff249ae.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_22f70f34e4a7e39fdb2aa9841748cc7bbb18ac7d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_453a0e5bc82e5401a1742d7a955d5a1832a5d7b1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_10a74a79352a5e13607fa2b7c732186d1c67d6e3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_c81c5b477bc32a9ba0893a796bc7a5ba89ea0633.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_47190db23d847f648333e806eeddb925a1b0f4c9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_65944ebf80f21df256b8f18b60a1c38deacff9a5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_89840d572dbe7c7bb22c7796b0d511c75aaf0fe1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_88d55d2249385460a434e802c4f73568dbeca5f0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_577784115f5550de311960100799a53cbf92a9de.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_4faf9305ca187c787f315a3e1764181cdbfa5a38.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_769552b5a36e2d56f3ccb013b155373c0e17f8ad.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_397be0fa648f76db83662d886f07c4f3de9d679c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_31aa64d32fa7b10b7f94ab51408210825056c842.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_0a8a52501655c6e2869376868bc5c7bd7ebc8046.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256677348/movie_max.mp4?t=1483567252

231330,Deadfall Adventures,"Nov 15, 2013",100000 - 200000,4,0,19.99,0,"Deadfall Adventures is an action-driven first-person shooter, spiced up with elements from action-adventure games. Become an adventurer, hunt for treasures, explore unknown regions of the world and rescue the damsel in distress from the clutches of enemies, both earthly and not-so-earthly. Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe! The Story The year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike. Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well. But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather's stories are not as crazy as he had always believed. For all things live forever, though at times they sleep and are forgotten... Key Features Action -Adventure gameplay from a first-person perspective Set in the Quatermain-universe, created by H. R. Haggard Fast-paced action and intense, accurate FPS gun battles Adventurer equipment: compass, treasure maps, notebook and flashlight – necessary to solve ancient puzzles, find treasures and even to defeat certain types of enemies Puzzles that encourage you to explore the game environment and interact with it Environmental traps that can be used to eliminate enemies in many spectacular ways Exotic, picturesque locations from around the world – Egypt, Arctic and forgotten Mayan ruins in the jungles of Guatemala Compelling story faithful to the spirit of classic action-adventure movies 1930’s setting, including detailed weapon designs Unique adventurer-style multiplayer features and modes","['English', 'German', 'Polish', 'French', 'Russian']","['English', 'German', 'Russian']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/header.jpg?t=1561964976,http://www.deadfall-game.com/,,support@quanticlab.com,True,False,True,53,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/deadfall-adventures?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,1716,628,,50,1140,,324,0,431,0,The Farm 51,THQ Nordic,"Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards","Action,Adventure","Adventure,Action,FPS,Shooter,Multiplayer,First-Person,Singleplayer,Puzzle,Zombies,Co-op,Indie,Horror,Survival,Exploration,Open World,Action-Adventure,World War II,Strategy","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_e53512c37c3b4927efec4ef2dccec62084af5a57.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_e5660e00480523bab71e5758c6606de0abf9bebf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_eb71d7cb42e05f68b50d14a3d2a8bd60145acb98.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_6ce7d35e3e24b9f5d35d8ebb27a0ca793ad08361.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_8b3791b17d55df0461262b23192a725f80de2593.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_d30c427a0ce9d8b04ca0809ae71f5356e0204e73.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_3109f03c94c404b51e5775ad86a60e81e132ad19.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_0ae6376d1947a3907690ed0a725e81d589cf5760.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_d4e66c6d44b80b5835acabad30cb60292267e922.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_ccc8d733e5f5e565ceaa4be6d8edcf6bdab95079.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_b6ef227c36746b589e96d57eb3b09fba2d2c1cc6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_18bb9893a8c153b743417f8ada5526d7e172170b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_5b3342439c4a7fcb93ab253be906817f849da3e7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_6338aab220eabdf66b1137d0ad71278b255ce39f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_8292d4dd3ea71a927d2b8b09c41a4856e72b59fd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_27bd5bdb26ed53217bf31d013e795d0d5376e880.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_aac2586e6d2a200f246c11f399216576bad38dc1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_aac19564f29ac14d3b70f1bbae5d6233284530cc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_763fee337f9ec69f6c6724460264e7c92d09c1ba.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_f70a0c7cc773129ef12bd9ebcaf9bfcba74c637c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029553/movie_max.mp4?t=1490862566,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030185/movie_max.mp4?t=1490862575,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028438/movie_max.mp4?t=1490862584,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030143/movie_max.mp4?t=1493809128,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030092/movie_max.mp4?t=1493809135"
